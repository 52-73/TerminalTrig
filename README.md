# TerminalTrig
Displays trig functions in ASCII form in the terminal with a gradient and varying magnitudes, using C.

## To Compile

```sh
gcc -o terminal_trig terminal_trig.c
```

## Documentation

In it's current state, there are two main functions within the program; `print_fx()` and `print_fy()`, which respectively print f(x) and f(y) respectively to the terminal screen in 
ASCII code (or rather, the inequality region below f(x) or f(y)). Both of these utilise the same `f()` function declared earlier, which in this case is `sin(x)`, multiplied by a 
constant in order to better fit the screen.

## `factorial()`

## `f()`

## `print_fx()`

## `print_fy()`
